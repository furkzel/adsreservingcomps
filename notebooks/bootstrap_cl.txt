        "### **1. Introduction and Actuarial Objectives**\n",
        "\n",
        "This document, dated June 7, 2025, constitutes the fourth and final analytical phase of our project. This phase addresses a critical limitation of the deterministic Chain-Ladder (CL) model from Phase II by quantifying the uncertainty inherent in loss reserving.\n",
        "\n",
        "The deterministic CL method produces a single point estimate of the ultimate loss, which, while useful, provides no information about its potential variability. [cite_start]The objective of this phase is to implement the **Bootstrap Chain-Ladder** method to derive a probability distribution for the ultimate losses and the corresponding Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) reserves[cite: 3]. This allows us to assess two key components of reserve risk:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Process Risk**: The inherent randomness in the claim development process, even if the underlying parameters (development factors) were known.\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Parameter Risk**: The uncertainty associated with estimating the development factors from a limited historical dataset[cite: 4].\n",
        "\n",
        "[cite_start]By simulating a full distribution, we can establish a credible range of outcomes, providing a richer context for evaluating both the deterministic CL and the machine learning model predictions from prior phases[cite: 5].\n",

        "### **2. Mathematical Framework: The Bootstrap Chain-Ladder**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bootstrap Chain-Ladder, a method proposed by England and Verrall, is a simulation technique used to estimate the prediction error of the Chain-Ladder reserve estimate. It operates by resampling the residuals from the initial deterministic model to generate a large number of simulated loss triangles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let the cumulative paid loss triangle be denoted by **$C$**, with elements $C_{i,j}$ for accident year $i$ and development lag $j$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bootstrap algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  [cite_start]**Fit a Deterministic Model**: First, we fit the standard volume-weighted Chain-Ladder model to the triangle **$C$**[cite: 10]. This involves calculating the age-to-age factors, $\\hat{f}_j$, for each development period $j$:\n",
        "    $$\\hat{f}_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n-j} C_{i, j+1}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n-j} C_{i, j}}$$\n",
        "    [cite_start]Using these factors, we construct the fitted cumulative loss triangle, $\\hat{C}_{i,j}$, where $\\hat{C}_{i,1} = C_{i,1}$ and for $j > 1$, $\\hat{C}_{i,j+1} = \\hat{C}_{i,j} \\cdot \\hat{f}_j$[cite: 16].\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  [cite_start]**Calculate Pearson Residuals**: We then calculate the scaled Pearson residuals, $r_{i,j}$, which measure the standardized difference between the actual and fitted values for the upper (observed) part of the triangle[cite: 11]. The formula is:\n",
        "    $$r_{i,j} = \\frac{C_{i,j} - \\hat{C}_{i,j}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{C}_{i,j}}}$$\n",
        "    These residuals are adjusted to have a mean of zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Bootstrap Resampling**: We perform **N** simulations. In each simulation **k**:\n",
        "    a.  [cite_start]A new set of residuals, $r^*_{i,j}$, is created by sampling **with replacement** from the original set of Pearson residuals[cite: 12].\n",
        "    b.  [cite_start]A simulated pseudo-triangle of losses, $C^*_{i,j}$, is generated using these resampled residuals[cite: 20]:\n",
        "        $$C^*_{i,j} = \\hat{C}_{i,j} + r^*_{i,j} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\hat{C}_{i,j}}$$\n",
        "    c.  [cite_start]The lower-right (unobserved) half of this pseudo-triangle is completed using a new set of development factors, $\\hat{f}^*_j$, calculated from the upper-left half of $C^*_{i,j}$[cite: 13, 21]. This step is crucial as it introduces **parameter risk**.\n",
        "    d.  The process is further refined by simulating individual incremental losses from a distribution (e.g., Gamma) to introduce **process risk**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Analyze the Distribution**: After completing all **N** simulations, we obtain a distribution of total IBNR reserves. [cite_start]We can analyze this distribution to calculate the mean, standard deviation (a measure of volatility), and various quantiles (e.g., 5th and 95th percentiles) to form a confidence interval[cite: 14, 24].\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Model Implementation**\n",
